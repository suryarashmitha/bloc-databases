> Write out a generic SELECT statement.

A: 	SELECT <column1, column2, ... *>
	FROM <table1, table2 ...>
	<optional: WHERE <condition>>

> Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

A: I think ‘select, from, where’ is already easy to remember.

> Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

<Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").>

- Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

A: SELECT name, gender, age
   FROM dogs
   WHERE breed LIKE '%LAbrador%';

-Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

		SELECT id
		FROM dogs
		WHERE age < 1;

-Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

		SELECT name, age
		FROM dogs
		WHERE gender = ‘F’
		AND weight > 35;

-Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

		SELECT *
		FROM dogs
		WHERE breed NOT LIKE %Shepherd%;

-Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

		SELECT id, age, weight, breed
		FROM dogs
		WHERE weight > 60
		OR breed = ‘great dane’;

> Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

A:	-SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

		(‘Mushi’, '2016-03-22’),
		('Seashell’, NULL),
		('Azul’, '2016-04-17’),
		('Victoire’, '2016-09-01’),
		(‘Nala’, NULL);

	-SELECT name, age FROM cats;
			
		(‘Mushi’, 1),
		('Seashell’, 7),
		('Azul’, 3),
		('Victoire’, 7),
		(‘Nala’, 1);

> From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.
- Display all the information about all of the available cats.

A: SELECT * FROM cats;

- Choose one cat of each age to show to potential adopters.

A: SELECT * FROM cats WHERE id < 4; 

- Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

A: SELECT DISTINCT name FROM cats;

- List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!

A: < less than, searching apartments that have been listed for less than a month.
   > greater than, checking for yelp ratings greater than 3 stars.	
   <= less than or equal to, searching apartments that are less than or equal to my max budget.
   >= greater than or equal to, searching for jobs with salaries greater than or equal to my minimum to pay the bills.
   !=(<>) not equal to, searching for new books in a library whose titles are not equal to ones I’ve read.
   = equal to, finding shoes at a yard sale that are equal to my size.

> From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?
-SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;
		(‘Seashell’),
		(‘Nala’);
-SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;
		(‘Mushi’),
		(‘Seashell’),
		(‘Victoire’),
		(‘Nala’);
-SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;
		(3),
		(4);
